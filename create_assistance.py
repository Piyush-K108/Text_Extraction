            "file_type": "<type_of_file>",
            "data": {
                "Total_Amount": "<amount>",
                "Payment_Date": "<date>",
                "Payment_Reference_Number": "<payment_reference_number>",
                "Invoice_Number": "<invoice_number>",
                "Payment_Currency": "<payment_currency>",

                }
            }
        }

        Identify the file type: Based on the document's content.
        Extract all data: Include everything from the file, formatted as key-value pairs, without excluding any details.
        Return only the JSON: No text or comments, just the JSON structure.
